## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based Hospital Management System designed to simulate real-world healthcare data operations. It demonstrates key database design principles and showcases complex SQL usage for managing and analyzing patient health records. The database handles crucial patient details like name, gender, allergies, height, weight, date of birth, and doctors and their specialities, reflecting a robust foundation for medical data systems.
## Objectives
- Build a centralized patient database to help healthcare professionals access critical patient information quickly.
- Assist doctors in identifying high-risk patients based on allergy types, age, weight, or height irregularities.
- Enable analysis of age and gender distributions for better demographic insights in clinical research.
- Support region-specific healthcare planning by analyzing patient data across cities and provinces.
- Provide a foundation for developing digital health dashboards and predictive models using SQL.
- Help clinics and hospitals maintain structured and scalable patient records efficiently.
- My learnings in SQL
